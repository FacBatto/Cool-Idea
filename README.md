So, i'm learning how to code and all that healthy stuff
I hope I can create some useful apps for me and my fellow filmmakers
Yeah, I work as a editor in my country.
Also, I'm really young.
So, I don't know anything about life, death and the meaning of life.
But, I'm gonna improve upon that point.
And learning to code is part of the process.
